kenken-player
=============

Someday (?) this will be a KenKen player/solver written in swift.

It's just in the early stages and doesn't do any solving yet. Also there's no UI.

It's a simple test project I created to try out swift and XCode, and now github :).

The solver can currently:
- given a set of KenKen constraints, generate the list of possible values for a set of cells in a table
- handle the case where a constraint is on a single row or column, and only has N possible values where N is the number of cells in the constraint
